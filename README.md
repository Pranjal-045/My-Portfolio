Hi there! I'm Pranjal, and this is my portfolio website code built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and a touch of JavaScript. Let's dive into the features:

> But, wait! Have any cool project ideas to share or need some work done? Just shoot me an email at pranjal045@gmail.com. Let's chat over a virtual coffee! 😊 And if you're wondering why you should consider working together, check out projects like **Portfolio Website** (responsive personal portfolio with dark/light mode), **Task Manager** (full-stack task management application with user authentication), **Weather App** (real-time forecasts using external APIs), and more! Check out my complete profile here: https://github.com/Pranjal-045

## **Portfolio Features:**

* **Real-World Showcase 💻:** Check out my actual projects!
* **Optimized for Speed 🚀:**  SEO metadata, prefetching, and deferring for a snappy experience.
* **SEO Optimized** Just Replace The Content at <head>
* **And More!** See the details below.
  
## **Technologies Used:**

* HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript

## **Why This Web Developer Portfolio Stands Out**

* **User Experience Focus:**  The dual theme and speed optimizations show I care about delivering a great experience.
* **Attention to Detail:** Thoughtful font selections and animations add a polished touch. 
* **Real Projects:**  This isn't just about tech skills, it's about what I can build!
